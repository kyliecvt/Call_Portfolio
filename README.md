Hi, I'm Kylie!

I am a technical writer from Richmond, Virginia looking for the next part of my story. Although I recently graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in professional and technical writing (PTW), I still consider myself a student. I am eager to learn not only about technical writing but also about instructional and content design. When Iâ€™m not exploring the latest trends in the field of PTW, you can find me working out, on my Nintendo Switch, or playing with my Golden Retriever, Sadie.

I hope this portfolio gives you an idea not only of my writing abilities but my passion for the field of PTW. The following pieces are included in my portfolio:

1. An infoposter on phone addiction that I made with Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.
2. A social action poster on environmentalism that I made with Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.
3. A user guide on how to watch videos on YouTube that I made for the nonprofit organization, Code for Nepal. The manual was printed and distributed to people in Nepal to promote digital literacy.
4. A quick start guide on how to create a Gmail account.

Enjoy!

-Kylie
