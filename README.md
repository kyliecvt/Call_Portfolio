Hi, I'm Kylie!

I am a technical writer from Richmond, Virginia, looking for the next part of my story. Although I recently graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in professional and technical writing (PTW), I still consider myself a student. I am eager to learn about technical writing, instructional design, and user experience design. 

I hope this portfolio gives you an idea of my writing abilities and my passion for technical writing. I have included the following samples in my portfolio:

1. An info poster on phone addiction that I created using Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.
2. A social action poster I created using Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.
3. A user guide that I created for the nonprofit organization, Code for Nepal. Code for Nepal printed the guide and distributed it to students in Nepal to promote digital literacy.

Enjoy,

Kylie
